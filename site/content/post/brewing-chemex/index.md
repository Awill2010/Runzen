I've been a runner for as long as I can remember. I started my running journey playing soccer at the age of 4-5 and ran my first 5k at age 8. It's been 30 years now and I'm still going.

Running is a part of my genes. My parents are still getting after it now in their 60s. I hope I can keep up with them.

I love hearing about everyones different experiences with running. I find it inspiring. Talking to people or reading their stories about different races or memorable runs makes me want to lace up and hit the trails. It's my favorite way to get out and explore.

Running is more than just exercise for me. It's a holistic experience. It helps bring me focus in a chaotic world. It provides physical, mental, and spiritual fulfillment, much like the practice of yoga and meditation.

This idea led to the creation of RunZen. I wanted to create something that brings people together around the holistic power of running.

RunZen is a community for runners. Whatever your own motivation for running might be, let RunZen be a source of inspiration and motivation on your personal running journey.
