  Running is more than just an exercise. It is a holistic experience that affects our mind, body, and soul.

Sometimes life can feel chaotic. Juggling all of our responsibilities can seem impossible. Anxiety is becoming more and more common in our fast paced, over productive culture. We have to find time to step back and breath so it doesn't overwhelm us.

Running provides a much needed refuge in the chaos. Everyone knows the physical benefits of running such as a healthy cardiopulmonary system and strong muscles and bones. Many runners probably know and have experienced  the mental and spiritual benefits of running as well. Running stimulates the production of neurotransmitters that improve neurological function, as well as the hormones that produce a sense of calm and euphoria.

Running truly is a holistic experience.

Despite the chaos, the world is still a beautiful place. Running is a great way to get out and enjoy it.
